Coffee ordering system lab 6
To run the lab, simply open up the main java file and run it, it should launch without issue.
The Main file is where all the printing and coffee customization code is mostly in,
All the With... and the coffee files work essentially the same, they construct a new With... coffee decorator, the cost of each addition, and their ingredients. 
The staticstics class works on adding up the order costs and total sum due.
